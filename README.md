# Featuring Alang v0.1

- Easy usage
- Fast runtime
# What is Alang?
Alang is a C Interpreter written in Python.\
The name comes from Array-language, because you're writing the code in an Array.
Write your program like a csv, every keyword is seperated by a space.\
When defining a functions/classes code, use tabs.
# Compiling
The file extension for Alang is .ag\
This helps the executor to find your Alang program.\
The syntax is simple. Just use the following command:\
`python3 main.py example.ag`
# Running
You will get an executable file as output.\
On Linux, you can just type ./THE-EXECUTABLE-NAME after you gave it execution permissions(or run it in a GUI)\
On Windows, you can just type the executables name in the command line or click on it.
